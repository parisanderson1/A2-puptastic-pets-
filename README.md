## General Info
This project was created for Working with Data and Code A2. I chose to code a video game to challenge myself artistically and creatively. Additionally, I chose to code on Scratch because of its visual aesthetic and visual learning components which have enhanced my understanding of coding, algorithims and actors. 

## Features 
* Pick from 3 different puppies
* Name your puppy
* Accesories for your puppy (Bows and Collars)
* Health Bar
* 'Tiredness' Bar
* Put you puppy to sleep
* Feed your puppy

## Room for Improvement
* Health and Awake Bars

These bars are glitchy and after putting your dog to sleep they do not display as the full bar only the clone
* Sleeping feature

Will only display the sleeping graphic loop the first time you put the dog to bed and no other time. I could not figure out why.
